<p>Juggling Lab is a Java application for creating and animating juggling patterns.  It evolved from the
<a href="http://juggleanim.sourceforge.net">JuggleAnim</a> juggling applet, and extends JuggleAnim
by providing greater flexibility and user interactivity.</p>
<p>Juggling Lab is free for non-commercial use (more details
<a href="html/license.html">here</a>).  Portions are released under the
GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License</a>.

<h4>How to run Juggling Lab</h4>
<blockquote>

<p>Juggling Lab is written entirely in Java, so it will run on any platform
that supports the Java 2 Standard Edition platform.  It has been tested
extensively on Windows and Mac OS X, and we have reports of users
running it successfully on other Unix-like
operating systems as well (e.g., Linux, Solaris).</p>

<p><b>Windows:</b>
Double-click on the <b>JugglingLab.bat</b> file.  If it doesn't launch correctly,
you most likely have an older version of Java; try installing Sun's
<a href="http://java.com">latest version</a>.</p>

<p><b>Mac OS X:</b>
Juggling Lab works like any other application, and is launched by double-clicking.</p>

<p><b>Other:</b>
The executable jar file is <b>bin/JugglingLab.jar</b>.  Consult your
Java installation's documentation for instructions on how to run a jar file.
On Unix-like systems: (1) change your shell search path to
include the "java" command (try <b>'which java'</b> in the shell
to verify it's working), and
(2) execute the "JugglingLab.sh" shell script.</p>

<h4>How to compile Juggling Lab</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As distributed, Juggling Lab is already compiled so there
is no need to do so again unless you want to change the source code.  If you are
interested in adding new features to Juggling Lab, please consider becoming a
developer on the Juggling Lab project so that your features become
a part of the standard distribution; contact the <a href="mailto:jboyce@users.sourceforge.net">Juggling Lab project administrator</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that most of Juggling Lab is released under the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License (GPL)</a>.  The GPL requires that, if you make Juggling Lab publicly available, it must be accompanied by a copy of the source code in a machine-readable format.</p>

<p>First you need to extract the source code; it is distributed as a
compressed archive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Windows:</b>
Double-click on the <b>bin/extract_source.bat</b> batch file.  This should
create a directory called <b>source</b> in the main Juggling Lab directory.</p>

<p><b>Mac OS X:</b>
From a Terminal window, execute the <b>bin/extract_source.sh</b>
shell script.  This will create folders called <b>osx_project</b> and <b>source</b> in the
same folder as the main Juggling Lab application.</p>

<p><b>Other:</b>
The source code is archived in <b>bin/JugglingLab_source.jar</b>  Consult
your Java installation's documentation for instructions on how to expand
a jar file.  On Unix-like systems: (1) change your shell search path to
include the "jar" command (try <b>'which jar'</b> in the shell
to verify it's working), and
(2) execute the <b>bin/extract_source.sh</b> shell script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next you need to compile the source code:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><b>Windows and Other:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The distribution includes a file <b>build.xml</b>, which is a build
file for use with the Apache Ant Java build system.  Ant is free software
that is available for most platforms at
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">ant.apache.org</a>.</li>

<li>The default build target creates three files:  <b>bin/JugglingLab.jar</b>,
<b>bin/JugglingLabAWTApplet.jar</b>, and <b>bin/JugglingLab_source.jar</b>.  The latter source
archive must be included with Juggling Lab whenever it is made publicly
available, in the same directory as the executable jar files.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Mac OS X:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a sufficiently recent version of Apple's OS X development tools (<a href="http://developer.apple.com">download</a>).  The project file
will work with Xcode version 1.1, which requires at least Mac OS X 10.3 to run.</li>
<li>Launch the <b>osx_project/Juggling Lab.pbproj</b> project file to open the IDE.  There are three project targets, corresponding to the OS X application and the two jar distributions.</li>
<li>Project Builder puts the finished build products into the <b>osx_project/build</b> folder.</li>
<li>To fulfill the source code provision of the GPL, the project file creates a source code archive as part of the build process; this archive is inserted within the application bundle at <b>Juggling Lab.app/Contents/Resources/Java/JugglingLab_source.jar</b>.</li>
</ul>
